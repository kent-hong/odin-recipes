        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese beef pho, known as "<span lang="vi">phở bò</span>," is a traditional Vietnamese soup that has become a beloved dish worldwide. This aromatic and flavorful soup is made from a rich, slow-cooked broth that typically simmers for hours with a blend of spices like star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom. The base of the broth is usually beef bones, which impart a deep, savory flavor. Thinly sliced beef, often a mix of cuts like brisket, flank, and tenderloin, is added to the hot broth, cooking just enough to remain tender. Rice noodles form the base of the soup, soaking up the broth and making each bite deliciously satisfying.</p>
        <p>What sets Vietnamese beef pho apart is its balance of flavors and the fresh garnishes that accompany it. The soup is traditionally served with a side of fresh herbs such as Thai basil, cilantro, and mint, along with bean sprouts, lime wedges, and slices of chili for a customizable experience. The combination of the hearty broth, tender beef, and fresh, crisp garnishes creates a dish that is both comforting and invigorating. Whether enjoyed as a breakfast staple or a hearty meal at any time of day, pho is a culinary experience that reflects the depth and diversity of Vietnamese cuisine.</p>
