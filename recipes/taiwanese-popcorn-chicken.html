        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Taiwanese popcorn chicken, or "<span lang="zh-Hant">yán sū jī</span>," is a popular street food that has captured the hearts of food lovers around the world. These bite-sized pieces of chicken are marinated in a flavorful mix of soy sauce, garlic, and five-spice powder, giving them a savory and aromatic taste that’s unmistakably Taiwanese. After marinating, the chicken is coated in sweet potato starch, which gives it a unique, crispy texture when deep-fried. The result is a delightful contrast between the crunchy exterior and the tender, juicy chicken inside, making each bite irresistibly delicious.</p>
